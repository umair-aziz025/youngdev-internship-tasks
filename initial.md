‎# 🎮 Someone Somewhere – Web App Concept
‎
‎(A Fun Community Game Inspired by Nemrah Ahmed)

‎## 🛠️ Core Features

‎   * Infinite scroll so you can read everyone’s additions.
‎
‎2. *💬 Community Play Modes*
‎
‎   * *Quick Play (Public Room)* → Anyone can add lines, global storytelling chain.
‎   * *Private Room* → Friends create a room, share a code, and play together.
‎
‎3. *⭐ Special Themes / Prompts*
‎
‎   * Daily/weekly themes:
‎
‎     * Example: “Someone somewhere is falling in love in Paris” 💕
‎     * Example: “Someone somewhere just got betrayed in a business deal” 😏

‎
‎4. *📸 Creative Mode*
‎
‎   * Add *GIFs, emojis, or memes* with your “someone somewhere” line.

‎
